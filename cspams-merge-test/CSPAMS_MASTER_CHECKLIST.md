## ðŸ’¬ DECISION LOG

Use this section to document decisions made during implementation:

```
Decision 1: Form Data Storage
- Option: JSON in DB (chosen)
- Reason: Faster to implement, can migrate later
- Trade-off: Less queryable initially

Decision 2: Real-time Notifications
- Option: Reverb + Email + Polling (chosen)
- Reason: Best UX, fallbacks if Reverb fails
- Trade-off: More infrastructure

Decision 3: Concern Attachments
- Option: Encrypt individual files (chosen)
- Reason: Privacy-safe, flexible
- Trade-off: More code than whole-table encryption

(Add more as you make decisions...)
```
